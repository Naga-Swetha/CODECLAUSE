MUSIC PLAYER APPLICATION DESCRIPTION:-
This Python script implements a basic music player application using the pygame library. The application allows users to load a folder containing music files, play, stop, and pause the music, and displays the current status on a graphical window.

Key features of the MusicPlayer class:

1. Initialization: Initializes pygame and sets up the window for displaying the music player interface.

2. load_music_files: Loads music files from a specified folder path and stores their paths in the music_list attribute.

3. play_music: Loads and plays the currently selected music file using pygame.mixer.music.

4. stop_music: Stops the currently playing music.

5. pause_music: Pauses or resumes the currently playing music.

6. display_text: Helper method to display text on the pygame window.

7. run: Main method that runs the music player application loop, handling user input and updating the display accordingly.

The application provides keyboard shortcuts for controlling music playback: SPACE to play/pause, S to stop, and F to select a folder containing music files. The interface also displays the currently playing music and whether it's paused or not.

Overall, this script serves as a basic foundation for a functional music player application in Python. Users can extend and customize it further to add more features and improve the user experience.


RANDOM PASSWORD GENERATOR DESCRIPTION
This Python script generates a random password based on user-defined criteria for the number of letters, symbols, and numbers in the password.

Here's a brief description of how the code works:

1. The script starts by importing the random module, which is used for generating random values.

2. Three lists are defined:
   - `letters`: containing lowercase and uppercase letters of the alphabet.
   - `numbers`: containing digits from 0 to 9.
   - `symbols`: containing special symbols.

3. The user is prompted to input the desired number of letters, symbols, and numbers for the password.

4. A loop iterates through each input to generate random characters for the password. For each category (letters, symbols, and numbers), `random.choice()` is used to randomly select a character from the corresponding list, and the character is added to the `password_list`.

5. After generating characters for all categories, the `password_list` is printed to display the sequence of characters before shuffling.

6. The `random.shuffle()` function is used to shuffle the `password_list` to randomize the order of characters.

7. The shuffled `password_list` is concatenated into a single string to form the password.

8. The generated password is printed and displayed to the user.

Overall, this script provides a simple and customizable way to generate random passwords with varying combinations of letters, symbols, and numbers.
